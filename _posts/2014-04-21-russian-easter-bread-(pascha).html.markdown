Easter is a bright, joyful and family holiday to me. I’m Russian
Orthodox and my family always celebrated this day with Pascha bread and
dyed eggs. We put the icon of Christ in front of the bread and eggs
overnight and in the morning cut the bread at the breakfast together.
Then, of course, everyone would have an egg fight! We would hit each
other’s eggs and then see whose egg was intact after the fight!

Here’s the recipe for traditional Easter bread, or as we call it most
often - Pascha.

Ingredients:

-   3/4 cup butter, room temperature
-   1 1/2 cup warm milk
-   1 tbsp. salt
-   1 cup sugar + 1 tbsp.
-   2 pkgs. dry yeast
-   6 eggs, slightly beaten
-   8 cups flour
-   1 tsp. vanilla
-   1/2 cup raisins, washed, optional
-   white cake frosting

Directions:

1.  Dissolve yeast in warm milk and 1 tbsp. of sugar. Wait for it to
    rise, about 15 min.
2.  Add butter salt, sugar, and vanilla. Mix well.
3.  Stir in eggs.
4.  Add flour and raisins.
5.  Knead until smooth and elastic. Dough should be lighter than for
    regular bread.
6.  Let rise covered with plastic wrap in warm place until doubled.
7.  Punch down, divide and let rise again until doubled in the greased
    tall empty and clean coffee cans. (Yes, that’s what I used!) Don’t
    put too much dough in one can, or it will fall over when being
    baked.
8.  Place in 325 F preheated oven for 45-60 min or until the wooden
    stick inserted in the bread comes out clean.
9.  Let cool for at least an hour.
10. Cover with heated white cake frosting so that it drips down the
    bread a little.
11. Decorate with letters “XB” on top of the bread (with sprinkles or
    raisins) which means Christ is Risen!

Enjoy!
