This recipe was inspired by Huffingtonpost.com where I found it. Edward
and I both liked it and decided to make it one day. It is definitely one
of a kind and a very elegant dish. But I don’t think kids will like it
much as it has some white wine and no cheese in it!

Ingredients:

-   2 tablespoons butter
-   6 tablespoons olive oil
-   2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped
-   2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh rosemary
-   1/2 cup pitted Kalamata olives, drained and halved
-   6 artichoke hearts in oil, drained and cut into quarters
-   1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon dry white wine
-   Finely grated zest of 1/2 orange
-   7 cups (18 ounces) rigatoni
-   Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:

1.  In a large skillet or wok, melt the butter with the oil. Once hot,
    add the garlic, rosemary, olives, and artichokes and sauté over
    medium heat for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally with a wooden
    spoon.
2.  Pour in the wine and cook for an additional 2 minutes to allow the
    alcohol to evaporate.
3.  Add the orange zest, season with salt and pepper, and mix everything
    together. Set aside.
4.  Meanwhile, cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water
    until al dente. Drain and add to the pan with the artichoke mixture.
5.  Return the pan to high heat and mix everything together for 30
    seconds to allow the sauce to coat the pasta evenly.
6.  We made some garlic bread as well and it was really-really delicious
    together!

Enjoy!
