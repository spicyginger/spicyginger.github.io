I always thought that scones are difficult and time consuming to make… I
don’t know why, because when I saw how Edward made it, I completely
changed my mind! It takes probably less than 30 min to make and they are
so delicious and simple. They taste very fluffy and light.

Ingredients:

-   1 3/4 cup flour
-   1/3 cup sugar
-   2 tsp. baking powder
-   1 pinch of salt
-   5 tbsp. butter, chilled and shredded/cubed
-   1/2 cup chocolate chips
-   1/2 cup cream

Directions:

1.  Preheat oven to 400 F. Spray a baking sheet with a cooking spray.
2.  In a large bowl whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and
    salt.
3.  With a pastry blender or a large fork cut in the shredded butter
    until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
4.  Stir in chocolate chips. Mix in the cream to form a dough.
5.  Turn out the dough on a floured surface. Pat or roll into a 9 inch
    circle about 1/2 inch thick. Cut out 12 scones, pushing the dough
    scraps together for the last few. Transfer the scones to the baking
    sheet.
6.  Bake until golden brown, about 12 min. Move to wire rack to cool.

Enjoy!
