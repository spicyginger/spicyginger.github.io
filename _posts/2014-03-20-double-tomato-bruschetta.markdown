I found the recipe on my favorite site allrecipes.com. It makes about
12-14 servings.

Ingredients:

-   6 roma (plum) tomatoes, chopped
-   1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes, packed in oil
-   3 cloves minced garlic
-   1/4 cup olive oil
-   2 tbsp. balsamic vinegar
-   1/4 cup fresh basil, stems removed
-   1/4 tsp. salt
-   1/4 tsp. ground black pepper
-   1 French baguette
-   2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:

1.  Preheat the oven on broiler setting.
2.  In a large bowl, combine the roma tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes,
    garlic, olive oil, vinegar, basil, salt, and pepper. Allow the
    mixture to sit for 10 minutes.
3.  Cut the baguette into 3/4-inch slices. On a baking sheet, arrange
    the baguette slices in a single layer. Broil for 1 minute, until
    slightly brown.
4.  Divide the tomato mixture evenly over the baguette slices. Top the
    slices with mozzarella cheese.
5.  Broil for 2 minutes, or until the cheese is melted.

Enjoy!
