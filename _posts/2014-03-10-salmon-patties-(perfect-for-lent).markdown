It’s time of Lent. If you fast this recipe is a great treat for you this
time a year. If you don’t – it’s super easy to make and so healthy,
you’ll want to make it just like I did!

You’ll need:

-   1 (14.75 oz.) can of pink salmon
-   1 egg
-   1/2 cup plain bread crumbs + extra for coating the patties
-   1/2 yellow onion
-   1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley
-   2 tbsp. mustard
-   1 tsp. black pepper

Preheat oven to 375 F.

1.  Finely chop onion. Sauté in a pan on medium high with a little salt
    until onion is browned and soft.
2.  In a large bowl combine canned salmon (remove any bones if there are
    some), onion, parsley, bread crumbs, egg, mustard and pepper. Mix
    the mixture well with your fingers so that salmon is incorporated
    with all the ingredients. You won’t need salt because salmon is
    salted already.
3.  In a separate plate strew some bread crumbs for coating the patties.
4.  Form round small patties out of the mixture and coat with bread
    crumbs in a separate plate.
5.  Bake patties on a baking sheet lined with tin foil (this way you
    won’t need to wash the baking sheet!) for about 15 min. or until
    slightly browned. Don’t overcook or it will be dry.

Enjoy with a side of rice, veggies or as it is!
