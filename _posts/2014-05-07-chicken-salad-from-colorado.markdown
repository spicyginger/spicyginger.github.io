We took a trip to Denver, Colorado to see my good friends. They invited
us for a couple of days to support them while they are planning to move
there and just have fun. And we had such a great time!

It was so nice to see my friend Kamila to be happily newly wed and
building a great life with her husband Ted.

While we were there we, of course, enjoyed some great meals at the
restaurants in the mountains and in downtown. My favorite (and Kamila’s
too) was a chicken salad with avocado and honey mustard dressing.

It was just a perfect amount of avocado, juicy chicken, spice and
acidity. I know… salads can’t be fabulous in principle, well… because
they are just salads, but this one excited me and my friend!
