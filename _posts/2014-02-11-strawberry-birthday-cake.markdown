It was my niece's 4th birthday and I had to come up with a cake that
will suit her love of anything pink(!) and my interest in dessert
recipes that don't take too much time and relatively easy to make. Oh,
by the way - the main reason I made this cake from scratch is because I
went to a grocery store with a strong determination to buy a simple cake
mix. Then I looked at the ingredients (just out of curiosity) and...
couldn't pronounce whatÂ was written on the box. I felt bad for my
4-year-old beautiful niece that will have to start eating box food from
such an early age, and decided that I would pick a very easy recipe and
make a dessert from scratch.

So here are the ingredients for the most delicate strawberry cake I've
ever had (you can see the video from Cookies, Cupcakes and Cardio
[here](http://www.youtube.com/embed/dh8ii5sbv)):

-   2/3 cup strawberry puree (about 1 1/3 c whole strawberries, fresh or frozen, thawed) (160mL)
-   3 cups All Purpose flour (360g)
-   2 teaspoon baking powder
-   2 teaspoon baking soda
-   1/2 teaspoon salt
-   1/2 cup milk (120mL)
-   1 teaspoon vanilla extract (5mL)
-   1 cup butter (salted or unsalted) (240g)
-   2 cups sugar (400g)
-   2 whole eggs
-   4 egg whites

Bake at 350F for 40-45 minutes.

For the buttercream topping:

-   vanilla buttercream (white)
-   fresh sliced strawberries for garnish
-   excess strawberry puree for garnish
-   wilton \#21 Tip piping bag

I actually replaced buttercream topping with a very easy to make cream
cheese frosting:

-   8 oz. pack of cream cheese
-   half a stick of unsalted butter (room temperature)
-   powdered sugar to taste Combine all together and you'll have the tastiest frosting ever!
