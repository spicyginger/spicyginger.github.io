We celebrated traditional Russian holiday Maslenitsa on March 2nd. It is
a week before Lent called otherwise Butter Week, when you can have a
real feast with blini, desserts and tea or coffee.

Since I work at the church, I was responsible for feeding the parish
with this great old fashioned dish. We have around 80 active families
with about 3 kids each attending the services, so I definitely needed
help!

Edward and my friend Leah were my rescue on the night of March 1st. We
had to make no less than 100 of blintz, and … we did it!

Here’s one of the huge pans that we brought to the church next morning.

I use my mother’s old fashioned recipe and blini always turn out finger
licking great!

You can stuff blini with any preferred filling or just serve plain with
butter. Either way they are fantastic.

We offered a choice of blini with Nutella filling, sweetened condensed
milk (you can buy it at any retail grocery store), and plain blini with
sides of sour cream, sweetened condensed milk, honey and preserves with
fresh berries.

Here’s a recipe for plain blini that people of any nationality love:

You need:

-   2 cups of flour
-   1/3 cup sugar
-   1 tsp. salt
-   about 2 cups of milk
-   3 tbsp. of vegetable oil
-   1 tbsp. butter plus butter to daub blini with
-   3 eggs
-   1/2 tsp. baking soda
-   1 tsp. vinegar

Instructions:

1.  Combine flour with sugar and salt.
2.  Add milk and eggs. Stir.
3.  Add vegetable oil.
4.  In a teaspoon with baking soda pour the vinegar, you’ll see the
    reaction. This is what you need. It will make blini look beautiful
    with lots of small holes that absorb butter quickly. Add that to the
    mixture.
5.  Mix all the ingredients on high speed with electric mixer for about
    5 min. until you see that there are no lumps, the batter is smooth
    and a little foamy. The consistency should be similar to buttermilk.
6.  It is better to cook blini in a cast iron flat skillet. Blini won’t
    stick to the bottom this way. On a medium high heat add tbsp. of
    butter to the skillet. When it’s melted pour it to the mixture. This
    is the only time when you put butter in the skillet.
7.  Pour a full ladle of mixture to the center, then tilt the skillet to
    the sides so that the batter spreads around. Blini batter should
    form a circle. ![file](/img/image-1399850732705.png)
8.  After a few seconds (SECONDS, it doesn’t take a long time at all)
    flip the blin with flat spatula, working from the center, just like
    pancake.
9.  About 5 seconds later blin is ready. Daub sides with butter and it’s
    ready to taste! If you want to add more sugar or salt you can still
    add it to the batter.

Prijatnovo appetita! Bon appetite!
