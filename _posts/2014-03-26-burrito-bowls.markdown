Tonight, I made burrito bowls that are similar to what you would find at
some chain Mexican restaurants. These are super simple dishes to make.
For the most part, these recipes are not very detailed about how much of
a single ingredient to use. Use your best judgement and taste things as
you go along. That is a major part of cooking.

### Corn Salsa

Ingredients:

-   1/2 red onion, diced
-   1 bell pepper, diced
-   1 can of corn (or equivalent amount of frozen)
-   pinch of red pepper flakes (or a lot more if you like things spicy)
-   splash of lime juice
-   1/3 cup of chopped cilantro
-   salt
-   pepper

Combine ingredients in saucepan and heat on medium until everything is
heated through and the onions cook a little bit. Serve hot or cold.

### Cilantro Lime Rice

-   1 cup basmati rice
-   2 cups water
-   1 tablespoon of vegetable oil
-   splash of lime juice
-   1/3 cup of chopped cilantro

In a rice cooker, add oil, rice, water, and lime juice. Cook rice until
done. Mix in cilantro.

### Chicken & Pinto Beans

For the pinto beans, I use canned. Heat on medium with salt and pepper.

In a skillet, heat oil and saut√© garlic. Add cubed chicken breasts.
Season with salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, and chili powder, and cook
until cooked through. Serve over cilantro lime rice, beans, and corn
salsa.
