Salted salmon is something I can crave for, it's so popular in my half
Russian, half Korean family that my mom shared this great easy recipe
with me. You can eat it as it is or make sushi rolls without spending
\$8 for 6 tiny rolls!

-   Fresh salmon, big piece, maximum 0.5 in. in thickness
-   Coarse sea salt, generous amount
-   White sugar, a few tbsp.
-   Garlic powder, to taste
-   Black pepper, to taste

Directions:
-----------

1.  Sprinkle salmon generously with salt on both sides.
2.  Wrap it in parchment paper and leave at a room temperature for 3
    hours.
3.  Sprinkle lightly with sugar on both sides. Wrap again (use the same
    paper) and leave for 1 hour.
4.  Remove completely all the salt and sugar from salmon by scraping it
    off with used parchment paper.
5.  Add black pepper, garlic powder and any salmon spices according to
    your taste on both sides.
6.  Wrap it again in clean parchment paper and leave in the refrigerator
    for 3 hours.
7.  Remove the paper and cut thin slices.

Later we used it for our fantastic home made sushi rolls. I was so
excited that I ate just a bit too much! You can use any ingredients,
including avocado, tomato, cucumbers, cilantro and cream cheese. Always
use sticky sushi rice though for best results. Just improvise, it will
be delicious, because YOU made it!
