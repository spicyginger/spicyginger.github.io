Pizza is one of my favorite foods. I will always be on a quest towards
making the perfect pizza at home. I think I have the dough about
perfect.

### Pizza Dough

Ingredients:

-   185g Bread flour
-   115g filtered water (around 110 F)
-   8g yeast (1 packet)
-   5g sugar
-   good pinch of Kosher salt

Instructions:

You can bloom the yeast by mixing the sugar with some of the water and
adding the yeast. If you are sure the yeast is fresh, you can skip this.
I usually do.

Mix all ingredients together and form into a cohesive mass. It will
still be rather wet and sticky.

Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead it for about 10 minutes.
During this time, you should feel the dough change. It will turn
elastic. You are creating gluten when you knead and gluten is very good
for pizza.

Form dough into ball and place into a greased bowl. To rise, I put this
bowl into my oven with a pan of boiling water on a lower rack to warm
the oven and create a little bit of steam. Because of the warmth, the
rise should take about an hour to double in size. This can greatly vary
due to environmental factors such as humidity, temperature, and
altitude. It is done rising when it doubles. I punch down and do a
second rise.

Remove dough from the bowl and make into a pizza shape. If the dough
gets tough while you are working it, step away and let it relax a little
bit. A rest will male the dough easier to work and it won't spring back
when you stretch it.

Have your oven set to the highest setting it has. I use 500 F on
convection. To (poorly) mimick a pizza oven in my own home, I line a
rack with unglazed terra cotta tiles. I heat them for about 40 minutes
to an hour in the oven beforehand. Top the pizza with whatever you like.
Bake directly on the tiles until the crust is crisp and the toppings are
done.

I think I need to build a pizza oven now....
