We stayed at the Hilton hotel in New York while on a vacation, and they
had this big jar of free cookies available to everyone every night in
the lobby. By the way – great job, Hilton, I always enjoy your service!

So these cookies looked so inviting and joyful that I just wanted to
take a bite (although I am a bit indifferent to cookies, Edward on the
other hand is a Cookie Monster!). And then… I fell in love: chewy,
moderately sweet, they’ve got my favorite white chocolate, dried
cranberries and lots of oats. And they were shaped as bars rather than
traditional round cookie shapes. What a delight, Edward and I both loved
them. So I decided to experiment at home and try to make them.

I found a great video that step-by-step explains how to make these
cookies at allrecipes.com. Click here to watch it.

Here’s how they turned out!

Ingredients:

-   1.5 sticks of unsalted butter (room temperature)
-   2/3 cup of brown sugar
-   2 eggs
-   1.5 cups of oats
-   1.5 cups of flour, mixed with 1 tsp. baking soda and a pinch of salt to taste
-   1 cup of dried cranberries
-   2/3 cup white chocolate chips
-   Preheat your oven to 375F.

Instructions:

1.  Using a stand mixer (or as I did with a fork) beat butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy.
2.  Add eggs, them scrape off the batter from the mixer/fork.
3.  Add oats
4.  Add flour mixture
5.  Stir in cranberries and white chocolate chips
6.  The video says to add some nuts after but I omitted those.
7.  Spread the mixture on a parchment paper lined baking sheet in a thin layer. Bake for about 15 min or until browned.
8.  Enjoy!
