Edward and I got married!! Yesterday! And I still savor the feeling and
pinch myself! We are now officially the Larkey family. We had the
courthouse ceremony at 10:30 in the morning and decided to go for a very
early romantic breakfast before getting married. And we went to La Peep
on 180th & Center in Omaha. The weather was "whispering" as we say it in
Russia, it was sunny but not too hot, fresh and energizing. And the
breakfast was fantastic, very hommy, very warm and just from the heart.

Edward had french toast and I had stuffed crepe with hash brown
potatoes. My husband (yay!) loved his fresh coffee as well. My crepe was
filled with some mushrooms, green onions, bell pepper, and cheese, and
topped with hollandaise sauce. Delicious!

I'll remember this breakfast forever...
