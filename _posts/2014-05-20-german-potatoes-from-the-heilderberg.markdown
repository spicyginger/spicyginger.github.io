Edward took me to Columbia, MO to his friends' wedding and also wanted
to show me his favorite university and restaurants. We went to The
Heidelberg restaurant first thing when we arrived - we were starving!
Edward said, 'I'll order German potatoes, when you try them you'll love
it!'

They looked kind of timid and inconspicuous but in reality were
unbelievably tasty with a little vinegar, bacon and probably just a hint
of sugar. I'd recommend to anyone.

I ordered fish & chips and they left me want more next day! I'll
definitely be back.
