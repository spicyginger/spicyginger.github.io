By Natasha

Tilapia in parchment paper, honestly, is one of my favorite recipes and
to-go dishes that I make on a weekly basis.

What’s so good about it is that it’s a very versatile dish, you can
experiment and add different vegetables leaving the basics the same.
Plus it’s so flavorful and juicy, you’ll love it!

What you’ll need (for 4 people):

-   4 tilapia fillets
-   bunch of asparagus
-   4 lemon slices
-   1 sprig of fresh thyme divided into 4 parts
-   5 tbsp. of olive oil
-   salt & pepper to taste
-   and of course, parchment paper (4 average squares)

Directions:

Preheat oven to 375 F.

1.  Place tilapia fillet in the center of a square of parchment paper
    and sprinkle 1 tbsp. of olive oil on top. Add salt and pepper. (If
    fillet is frozen, place it in a bowl with cold water for about 30
    min to thaw.)
2.  In a separate bowl combine a whole bunch of asparagus with 1 tbsp.
    of olive oil, salt and pepper.
3.  Place 1/4 of thyme on top of fillet.
4.  Put 1 lemon slice on top.
5.  Put 1/4 of asparagus on top.
6.  Cover the fish and veggies with other side of the parchment paper
    and fold, making small triangles, until you form a pouch.
