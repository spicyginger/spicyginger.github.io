Our church wedding is coming up in September, and according to Russian
tradition my mom should greet me and my husband at the reception hall
with Karavay, elaborate wedding bread. Then bride and groom bite the
bread, and everyone compares their bites. Whoever's is bigger, that
person will be the head of the family! It's just a fun Russian
tradition, but the bread itself symbolizes love and prosperity in the
family.

We first thought that Hy-Vee could bake us some bread, and sent them a
picture of a possible bread. But they called me and said they can't make
decorations on top of the bread, which I was sure was very easy to make.
And with that thought my mom and I decided to try to make it before the
wedding! It turned out beautiful and so tasty! Plus the recipe is very
easy.

Ingredients:
------------

-   About 2 cups of flour
-   1 tsp. salt
-   5 tbsp. white sugar
-   1 tbsp. brown sugar
-   1 packet active yeast
-   1 cup warm water
-   Cooking spray
-   3 sweet apples, peeled and sliced thinly
-   1 tsp. cinnamon
-   About 1/2 cup buttermilk
-   1 egg yolk, mixed with 1 tsp. vegetable oil
-   A little bit of butter to rub on top of the bread at the very end

Directions:
-----------

1.  In a bowl combine warm water, yeast and 2 tbsp. of sugar and let
    rise a little. When you see a froth on top, it's ready.
2.  In a separate large bowl mix flour, rest of the white sugar and
    salt.
3.  When yeast mixture is ready, combine it with the flour mixture.
    Adjust the thickness of the dough by adding buttermilk. It shouldn't
    be too dense, just tender to the touch. Form a round dough.
4.  Spray cooking spray in a separate large bowl and put the dough
    there. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for at
    least 30 min.
5.  Cut 1/4 of the dough for decorative pieces.
6.  Cut the rest of the dough in half and roll two halves into round
    pieces (like for a pie)
7.  Mix apple slices with cinnamon and brown sugar.
8.  Add apple misture on top of the first layer, then place the other
    layer on top and tightly close under the first layer to form a ball.
9.  Make flowers, wheat stalks, and long braid if you want and place
    them on top of the bread by gluing them with water to the dough.
10. Finally, brush the top with the yolk mixture and put in the oven at
    350 on the lowest rack for 40 min.
11. Let rest for 5-10 min. and enjoy!
