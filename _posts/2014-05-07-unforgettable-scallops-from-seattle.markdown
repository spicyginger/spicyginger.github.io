My sister and her husband went to Seattle for couple of days, and as
soon as they arrived, they emailed me these wonderful pictures of their
meal at one of the downtown restaurants that they really wanted to share
with you all.

I think, this is one of the most sophisticated meals Iâ€™ve seen in
several years! The scallops, according to them, were unbelievable: the
official name of the dish is Day Boat Scallop with Foie Gras. It is
served with a vanilla bean-scented carrot puree and mascarpone-filled
figs. Finished with a cascade blackberry demi-glace sauce. My
brother-in-law said it had a hint of chocolate as well. Wow! Who wants
to go to Seattle?
