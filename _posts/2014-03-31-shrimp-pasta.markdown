This recipe is one of my favorites. It’s so easy to make and it will
take less than 30 min overall. Very elegant and sophisticated too!

Ingredients (serves about 4 people):

-   1/2 regular spaghetti box
-   1 tbsp. olive oil + 3 tbsp. olive oil for the dressing
-   1 package of shrimp (peeled, deveined and washed; you can use either
    frozen or fresh)
-   1/2 yellow onion, chopped
-   3 cloves of garlic, chopped
-   2 tbsp. dry white wine (a good one)
-   2 tbsp. lemon juice
-   1 tsp. lemon zest
-   salt & black pepper to taste

Directions:

1.  Bring water to a boil in a large pot. Add some salt (the water
    should be slightly salty). Cook pasta until al dente. Drain through
    colander. Put back to the pot. Set aside. (By the time your pasta is
    cooked, your shrimp will be cooked as well!)
2.  In a separate bowl combine 3 tbsp. of olive oil with lemon zest and
    a pinch of salt and pepper. Set aside.
3.  In an average pan sauté onions with 1 tbsp. of olive oil, salt and
    pepper until it’s soft.
4.  Add shrimp and garlic.
5.  Sprinkle a pinch of salt and pepper again.
6.  If you use frozen shrimp, sauté it for about 1 min. Then add lemon
    juice and wine. If you use fresh shrimp, it’ll take only a few
    seconds before you can add other ingredients.
7.  Let wine reduce for about 2 min or so.
8.  Add shrimp mixture to the pot with pasta. Add lemon zest dressing
    and mix well with tongs.
9.  It’s going to smell so fresh and citrusy that you and your
    friends/family won’t be able to resist for too long!

Enjoy!
