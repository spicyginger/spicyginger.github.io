This post is solely about how I like Margherita flat bread… but not just
any – Margherita flat bread by Kona Grill in Omaha! They really need a
pat on a shoulder for this one. I always order Margherita flat breads in
different restaurants and hope to get the same excellent sweet and rich
taste that I get at Kona Grill, but so far only they can deliver it to
me. Great job!
